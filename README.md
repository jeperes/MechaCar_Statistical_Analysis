- The Vehicle length, and Vehicle ground clearance variables provide non-random amounts of variance.
- The slope can't be considered zero because is smaller than the 0.05% level. 
- The model is 71% accurate, so the linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes is effectively.

The overall variance of the suspension coils meet the criteria being under 100 pounds, but in the individual lots, the lot3 exceed the criteria being 170.2 pounds.
